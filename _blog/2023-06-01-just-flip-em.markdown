I took a 15-hour direct flight from Mumbai to JFK after my friend's wedding in India. My dad picked me up from the airport when I arrived and took me to my parents' home on Long Island. It was only 9:00am when I arrived, but I did what tells you not to do: I went straight to sleep. This set me up to be on a weird sleep schedule for the next week.

The next day, I woke up at 4:00 am and ran down to the Long Island Sound. It was low tide, and the beach was filled with upside-down horseshoe crabs, stranded by the receding water. Scavenging seagulls waddled along the shore, and I knew I couldn't leave the horseshoe crabs helpless.

I ran up and down the beach to flip them over, one by one. Some of them were slower than others, so I would carry them closer to the water or give them a gentle toss back into the sound. Not every re-entry was graceful; some crabs tumbled in the gentle waves for a few seconds before vanishing into the murky morning water.

Naturally, I went home and read all about horseshoe crabs. Despite growing up around them, I had never given them much thought. Here's what I learned:

1. People on the West Coast have never heard of them and often mistake them for dinosaurs (understandably)
2. Horseshoe crabs have blue blood that is important to medicine.
3. They have not evolved very much in their 450 million years of existance.
4. The Ecological Research & Development Group (ERDG) once made an entire song and music video featuring very 2000s-looking kids to promote a "Just flip 'em" campaign aimed at getting people to flip over upside-down horseshoe crabs so they can scuttle back to the ocean.

For about a week, while I was on this weird sleep schedule, it became my mission to get down to the beach before sunrise and "just flip 'em." I felt a sense of duty. If I didn't go, who would flip them? 

Eventually, my dedication to saving horseshoe crabs succumbed to my body's need for sleep. Sometimes I still wonder if there are any heroes waking up at the crack of dawn to "just flip 'em" before the seagulls get their snack.
