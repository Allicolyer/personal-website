[Feelsbot](https://www.feelsbot.me/){:target="\_blank"} is a machine learning experiment built using React, GraphQL and IBM Watson. Feelsbot can assess the average mood of any city based on the Tweets there, and can also assess the average mood of any Twitter user.

### How Feelsbot Works

Feelsbot uses a machine learning model from IBM to analyze emotions in
tweets. Using this algorithm, Feelsbot put tweets into five categories:
joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust. This algorithm only works in
English, so Feelsbot can only analyze tweets that are in English. Each
tweet receives a confidence level of how strongly it matches one of
those categories. Feelsbots puts tweets that have a confidence level
higher than 65% into each category. Once the tweets have been
categorized, the joy meter is calculated as the percentage joyful tweets
versus every other emotion.

When using the map, Feelsbot uses Twitter's API to fetch the last 100
tweets that are geotagged near the location entered. Often, there
are not many recent geotagged tweets. When this happens Twitter fetches
tweets of users whose profile locations are near the location entered
into the map. When analyzing tweets by a specific Twitter account,
Feelsbot fetches the last 150 tweets by that account. Twitter profiles
need to be public for Feelsbot to work.

### Technology Stack

Feelsbot was built using IBM Watson, React and GraphQL. GraphQL is used to send API requests to Twitter and IBM. React and Javascript was used to build the frontend of the site.
