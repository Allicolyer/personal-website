Part of my role as at Iridescent is to help build a Ruby on Rails web application for Technovation. The app supports five types of users: students, mentors, judges, ambassadors, and admins. Technovation is run in seasons, and requires the app to have different functionality during each month. Each user has very specific needs, which are described below:

1. Recruitment
  * Students and mentors must be able to form teams, ambassadors must be able to view and manage all their students and teams
2. Submission
  * Students must be able to submit their work online
3. Event Selection
  * Ambassadors must be able to plan events, and students and mentors must be able to sign up for them
4. Judging
  * Judges view and award scores to students work
5. Scores
  * Students and mentors can see the results of judging
