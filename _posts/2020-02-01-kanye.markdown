[Kanye.fun](www.kanye.fun) uses Markov chains to generate quotes that sound like Kanye
West.

### How Kanye.fun works

The site builds a Markov chain from two-hundred different Kanye West
quotes and uses that chain to generate quotes in a similar style to
Kanye. The Markov chain weights word differently based on how often they
appear next to each other. So for instance, if six quotes have the
combination ‘I am’ and only one has the combination ‘I have’, ‘I am’ is
six times more likely to appear in a generated quote than ‘I have’. Just
like with any Markov chain, there is always a chance that the generated
Kanye West quote is actually a real Kanye West quote.

Switching between ‘more random’ and ‘less random’ lets you choose
between using a first-order Markov chain and a second-order Markov
chain. First-order Markov chains use only on the last word to pick the
next word in a sentence. Second-order Markov chains use the last two
words in a sentence to predict the next one. The second-order chain
generates quotes that sound more like Kanye, while the first-order chain
generates sentences that are more jumbled and random.
