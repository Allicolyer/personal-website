At my current job, my team and I develop the judging materials for [Technovation](http://technovationchallenge.org/). Technovation is the largest technology entrepreneurship program for girls ages 10-18. Every year Technovation invites girls from around the world to identify a problem in their community, and then challenges them to solve it. In 2018 over 12,000 girls from more than 100 countries participated in Technovation.

### Overview
To participate in the competition, teams submit the following:

1. Pitch Video
2. Demonstration Video
3. Source Code
4. Business Plan

The submissions are judged by volunteer, international judges, both virtually and in-person. The judges need to be provided materials that are easy to understand and quick to pick up.

### Judging Rubric

In both 2017 and 2018, my team and I developed the [judging rubric](http://technovationchallenge.org/wp-content/uploads/judging-rubric.pdf){:target="_blank"} for the competiton. The rubric is aimed to give fair scores to all teams.  It focuses on scoring the teams in five major areas:

* Ideation
* Technical
* Pitch
* Entrepreneurship
* Overall Impression

The judging rubric gives opportunity for judges to award points for excellent work and effort, as well as for their impression of the submission.

### Judging Training
I developed the [judge training](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcFCpaYLqF2xtXDwqfq4guqeQKiyigWS5){:target="_blank"} for both virtual and in-person judges.

The judge training aims to take qualified volunteers with zero knowledge of the program to being able to fairly judge submissions created by teams around the world. The training is broken up into five short vidoes with the following themes:

1. Technovation Overview
 * Program Information and Technovation mission
2. Your Role as a Judge
 * The importance and power of Technovation judges
2. Parts of a Submission
 * What teams are submitting to the competition
3. Using the Judging Rubric
 * A walkthrough of the judging rubric
5. Constructive and Positive Feedback
 * How to be give good feedback to teams

### Code Checklist

The [code checklist](http://technovationchallenge.org/curriculum/code-checklist/){:target="_blank"} was a new aspect I created for the judging process in 2017.

Often times, judges give high scores in the "technical" category for teams that have apps that look nicer to to teams that have better produced demo videos. The goal of the code checklist is to give teams points for "effort" and to level the playing field for teams with less access to technology.

The teams provide explanations for how they used certain components in their code. They can earn up to 10 points for filling in the checklist.

After the 2017, a survey was taken and it was found that around 65% Technovation participants liked the code checklist and would like to keep it for the 2018 season.
