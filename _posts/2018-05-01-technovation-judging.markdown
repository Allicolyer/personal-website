[Technovation](http://technovationchallenge.org/) is the world's largest technology entrepreneurship program for girls ages 10-18. Technovation invites girls from around the world to identify a problem in their community and then challenges them to solve it. Each year more than 20,000 students participate from over 100 countries.

All submissions are scored virtually by qualified judges. To accomplish this, all projects are required to be submitted and judged through an online platform, and all judges must be trained on judging criteria. This presents many challenges, and to streamline these efforts, I developed the judging process for Technovation.

### Judging Rubric

The [judging rubric](http://technovationchallenge.org/wp-content/uploads/judging-rubric.pdf){:target="\_blank"} was created with the goal to evaluate all teams fairly. It focuses on scoring the teams in five major areas:

- Ideation
- Technical
- Pitch
- Entrepreneurship
- Overall Impression

The judging rubric gives the opportunity for judges to award points for excellent work and effort, as well as for the uniqueness and impressiveness of the submission.

### Judging Training

The goal of the judge training is for qualified volunteers with zero knowledge of the program to learn how to fairly judge submissions created by teams around the world. The training is broken up into five short videos with the following themes:

1. Technovation Overview
- Program Information and Technovation mission
2. Your Role as a Judge
- The importance and power of Technovation judges
2. Parts of a Submission
- What teams are submitting to the competition
3. Using the Judging Rubric
- A walkthrough of the judging rubric
5. Constructive and Positive Feedback
- How to give good feedback to teams

### Code Checklist

The [code checklist](http://technovationchallenge.org/curriculum/code-checklist/){:target="\_blank"} gives points to teams for learning computer science concepts. Students provide explanations for how they used certain components in their code.

Often times, judges give high scores to teams that have apps that look nicer or seem more complex. The goal of the code checklist is to give teams points for "effort" and to level the playing field for teams with less access to technology. The code checklist was introduced in 2017 and was well received by the Technovation audience.
