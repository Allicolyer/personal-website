As part of a graphic design course, I designed a poster for a retrospective at the New Museum about the work of Buckminster Fuller. The poster features the classic Dymaxion car overlayed with a retro-futuristic typeface. The contrast between the orange typeface and green car is bold and eye catching, but the surrounding whitespace prevents it from being overbearing. The New Museum's logo is featured in orange and gray aligned next to the event details.
