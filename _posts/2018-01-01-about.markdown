 I am an educational technologist and an advocate of free education. My technical background in chemical engineering and mathematics allows me to create scientific curriculum to increase science literacy for people around the world. I also work on civic tech projects to find ways for technology to increase equality and opportunities in society.

My journey as an educator began when I started teaching after-school programs while studying chemical engineering at The Cooper Union. This quickly ignited my passion for creating new educational experiences and opportunities for people. Since then, I have designed educational experiences for students ages K-12 and also for adults. I firmly believe that everyone has untapped capabilities and that the right experience can awaken those potentials.

In my spare time, I enjoy working on technology projects of my own. I participate in hack-a-thons and civic hacking groups. Some of my other hobbies include outdoorsy stuff, like hiking, camping, and mountain biking.
