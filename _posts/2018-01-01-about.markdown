 I am an educational technologist and an advocate of free education. My technical background in chemical engineering and mathematics allows me to create scientific curriculum to increase science literacy for people around the world. I also work on civic tech projects to find ways for technology to increase equality and opportunities in society.

Contact me or explore my site to learn more about what I do.


### Background
Ever since I was young, I have loved science. In high school, I grew to love chemistry and math, and I earned a full tuition scholarship to study chemical engineering at the Cooper Union.

During college, I volunteered to teach after-school programs to children and their families in the Bronx and in Queens. During this time, I realized how lucky I am to have been introduced to science at a young age and to have had freedom to explore and learn. Ever since then, my passion has been to make science accessible to everyone. I am driven to create opportunities for people to learn, explore, and be introduced to new things.

In my free time I like to work on electronics projects and build things. I am currently enjoying the sunny weather in Los Angeles, California.
