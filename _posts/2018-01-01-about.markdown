I am a full-stack software engineer who loves creating fun educational experiences. My passion is to use technology to bridge the education and opportunity gap for all people.

I am currently seeking new opportunities. I have professional experience in JavaScript, React, TypeScript, GraphQL, and Node.js. I previously worked as a software engineer at an educational non-profit and at a web development agency. I'm also a Recurse Center alumna. Right now, I am based in Los Angeles enjoying the sunshine and hiking trails.
