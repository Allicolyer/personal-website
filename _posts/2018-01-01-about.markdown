My journey as an educator began when I started teaching after-school programs while studying chemical engineering at The Cooper Union. This quickly ignited my passion for creating new educational experiences and opportunities for people. Since then, I have written technical curriculum to increase science literacy for people and children around the world. I have also developed software projects aimed to help people understand and learn new things. I firmly believe that everyone has untapped capabilities and that the right experiences can awaken those potentials.

In my spare time, I enjoy working participating in hack-a-thons and civic hacking groups. Some of my other hobbies include outdoorsy stuff, like hiking, camping, and mountain biking.
