I am a technical curriculum developer living in Los Angeles, California. My background is in chemical engineering and mathematics. I was born and raised on Long Island, NY. Every since I was young I have loved science. Some of earliest memories are of finding and capturing bugs in the salt marshes of Long Island during the hot summer days.
During high school I grew to love chemistry and math which lead to me to earn a full tuition scholarship to study chemical engineering at the Cooper Union. After spending a couple of years in NYC, I moved out west to Los Angeles, California.

During college, I volunteered to teach after-school programs to children and their families in both the Bronx and in Queens. It was during this time that I realized how lucky I am to have been introduced to science at a young age and to have had freedom to explore and learn. Every since then my passion has been to make science accessible and to give everyone the opportunity to learn, explore, and be introduced to new things.

In my free time I love to work on electronics projects and build things. I also love to spin up small website (like this one)! I am currently enjoying the sunny weather in Los Angeles and I love to ride my bike and fly kites.
