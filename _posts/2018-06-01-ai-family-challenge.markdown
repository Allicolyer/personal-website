Technovation Families is a global artificial intelligence program for families. The curriculum leads elementary and middle school children through the process of creating an AI invention to solve a problem in their community. The program was launched in 2018 and has been used by 7,500 people in 20 countries.

I was on the team that authored the first version of the curriculum. We created the curriculum around four major themes.

### Ideation

The curriculum focuses heavily on how to come up with an interesting problem and solution. It teaches participants how to build mental models of the world around them to quickly identify the causes and effects of different problems they observe. The curriculum helps families select a meaningful problem and conceptualize an effective solution. Families are guided to create solutions that benefit from using artificial intelligence technology.

### Artificial Intelligence

The curriculum teaches the foundations of machine learning. Participants explore ideas such as datasets, training, models, computer vision, and deep learning through examples and activities. Families use [Machine Learning for Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/) to train their own machine learning models to experiment and play.

### Entrepreneurship

The curriculum challenges families to treat their invention as if it were a product on the market. Through competitor and consumer research, families pin down their markets and build the best product for today's world. Families identify their minimum viable product that will solve their problem while satisfying their users' needs and standing out from competitors.

### Projects

Families learn how to showcase their inventions by recording five-minute videos and pitching their inventions to a panel of judges. They learn how to talk about their projects and the artificial intelligence technology that powers them. They also learn to tell the story of the problems and solutions that inspired their inventions.
