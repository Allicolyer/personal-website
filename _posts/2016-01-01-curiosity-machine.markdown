I work with engineers to make videos that are accessible to children of all ages and design hands-on engineering
projects that relate to the engineer's work.

I develop hands on curriculum around some of the most cutting edge engineering and science topics. Some examples include.

* Nanoscience
* Genetics
* Artifical Intelligence

descriptionWith the help of students and professors at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and the Iridescent video team, I am creating three videos for children aged late elementary school and older. These videos will explain three important concepts in nanoscience:

1. Quantum Dots
2. Nanofluidics
3. Nanolithography

The videos will be accompanied by three hands on projects developed by undergraduate students at RPI.


I worked with Elliot Meyerowitz, a scientist at California Institute of Technology, and the Iridescent video team to develop two videos and a hands on building project that teaches children about plant genetics. I developed the design for the project, several different prototypes, and two videos that all work together to deliver the concepts to a young audience.
