During my time at Iridescent I worked as a curriculum developer for [Curiosity Machine](https://www.curiositymachine.org/){:target="_blank"}. Curiosity Machine is a hands-on STEAM program for children, families and educators. In 2017 more than xxx participated in Curiosity Machine programs.

### Design Challenges

The main feature of Curiosity Machine is online design challenges. Design challenge are hands-on STEAM activities that are developed based on the work of scientists and engineers. All design challenges must:

* Use simple household materials
* Scale up or down for students K-12
* Have many possible solutions — there’s never one right answer!

I worked to develop many design challenges and videos featuring sceintists and engineers. Some of the topics I've developed these hands-on challenges around include:

* Artificial Intelligence
* Nanoscience
* Genetics
* Aerospace
* Biomimicry
* Mechanical Engineering
* Electrical Engineering

In addition to developing challenges, I also develop many supporting materials, such as videos, lessson plans, teacher guides, and more.

### Artificial Intelligence

During the Spring of 2017, my team and I developed three hands-on challenges to teach children and their families about artificial intelligencee. The three challenges are listed below:

| [Build a Parallel Processing Machine](https://www.curiositymachine.org/challenges/127/){:target="_blank"} | [Build a Neural Network](https://www.curiositymachine.org/challenges/126/){:target="_blank"} |[Build a Self Driving Car Game](https://www.curiositymachine.org/challenges/125/){:target="_blank"} |

{: .design-challenge}


The three challenges were tested out with a group of high schoolers at conference by NVIDIA. Afterwards they were incorporated in outreach events by NVIDIA and the AI Family Challenge.

### Nanoscience
With the help of students and professors at RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), and the Iridescent video team, I am creating three videos for children aged late elementary school and older. These videos will explain three important applications in nanoscience. The videos are accompanied by three hands on projects developed with the help of undergraduate students at RPI.

### Genetics
In the fall of 2015, I worked with Elliot Meyerowitz, a scientist at California Institute of Technology, and the Iridescent video team to develop two videos and a hands on building project that teaches children about plant genetics. I developed the design for the project, several different prototypes, and two videos that all work together to deliver the concepts to a young audience.

### Aerospace

In a partnership with Boeing, I worked with engineers to develop hands on projects around what they do

| [Engineer a Safe Stopping Robot](https://www.curiositymachine.org/challenges/109/){:target="_blank"} | [Engineer a Fuel Level Detector](https://www.curiositymachine.org/challenges/116/){:target="_blank"} | [Build an SLS Inspired Rocket](https://www.curiositymachine.org/challenges/117/){:target="_blank"} |

### More
In addition to these challenges, I've also developed and contributed to  many others. Some notable examples include

| [Planting Machine](https://www.curiositymachine.org/challenges/121/){:target="_blank"}| [Build a Blooming Flower](https://www.curiositymachine.org/challenges/68/){:target="_blank"} | [Make a Root System](https://www.curiositymachine.org/challenges/61/){:target="_blank"} |
