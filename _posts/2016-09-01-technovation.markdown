[Technovation](http://technovationchallenge.org/) is the world's largest technology entrepreneurship program for girls ages 10-18. Every year Technovation invites girls from around the world to identify a problem in their community and then challenges them to solve it. Girls work in teams and are supported by mentors to develop a mobile app and to launch a startup.

The Technovation curriculum is a twelve-week coding entrepreneurship curriculum. The curriculum has been translated into nine languages and is used by more than 20,000 students from over 100 countries each year.

### Curriculum Overview

As the lead curriculum developer for Technovation, I designed and authored the curriculum. The curriculum is split into four major categories: ideation, entrepreneurship, and pitching. Each lesson features activities for students to complete to help them learn important concepts and create materials to submit to the competition.

- **Ideation** - Students go through a series of activities to come up with an idea for their app.

- **Coding** - Students learn computer science basics and prototype a mobile app using MIT App Inventor or Thunkable.

- **Entrepreneurship** - Students create and execute a business plan to turn their ideas into startup businesses.

- **Pitch** - Students create videos to pitch their ideas and showcase their app.

### Coding Activities

Each coding lesson features an activity that asks students to complete a small part of an app or fix a bug. These activities help students build confidence in App Inventor and Thunkable while learning important computer science concepts.
