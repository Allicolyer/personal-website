During my time at Iridescent I worked as a curriculum developer for [Technovation](http://technovationchallenge.org/). Technovation is a technology entrepreneurship program for girls ages 10-18. Every year Technovation invites girls from around the world to identify a problem in their community, and then challenges them to solve it. Girls work in teams and are supported by mentors to develop a mobile app and to launch a startup. In 2017 over 11,00 girls from more than 100 countries participated in Technovation. Technovation provides a free online curriculum that assumes no prior knowledge, and the technology aspect revolves around using MIT App Inventor, also free. This provides a low threshold for increased inclusion at all socioeconomic levels.


### Curriculum Overview

On a team of three, I developed a twelve week, twenty-one unit curriculum for middle school and high school girls participating in the global Technovation Challenge. I developed both the structure and the content of the curriculum. The curriculum is split into four major categories: coding, business, marketing, and pitching. I was the principal developer for all seven coding units all five coding challenges, and some of the marketing units. I was a major contributor and editor for all of the units.

#### Code

Over the seven coding units, the curriculum takes students through the basics of programming so they can design a fully functioning mobile app with App Inventor.

#### Business

Over four business units, students learn how to their ideas into full startups. They learn core business principles and work on creating and executing a business plan.

#### Market

In three marketing units, students learn how to create a brand for their business. They learn why marketing is important and how it can help express the identity of your business. They create logos and mission statements for their business.

#### Pitch

In three pitching units, students learn how to pitch their ideas to an audience. They create both a pitch video showcasing their ideas and their work, as well as a demonstration video that show their app in action.

####  Student Workbook

In addition to developing all new curriculum, I also developed a student workbook designed to be used with the online curriculum. The workbook is a project management tool for students and their mentors. It highlights key words and activities throughout all of the units and reminds students when to upload to the online platform.

#### Translation
With my team I help guide the efforts to translate the curriculum into sixteen different languages. By working with voulenteer translators, we assess the needs of girls living in different regions and figure out the best way to deliver curriculum to them.

#### Student Learning Community
With my team I created a movement for Technovation student  to submit youtube videos explaining various concepts that they learned to participate in the challenge. Both alumni and current students can submit videos in their any language they want. The goal is to create a learning community for students and give students a chance to showcase their knowledge.
