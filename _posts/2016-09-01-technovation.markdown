During my time at Iridescent I worked as a curriculum developer for Technovation. Technovation is a technology entrepreneurship program for girls ages 10-18. Every year Technovation invites girls from around the world to identify a problem in their community, and then challenges them to solve it. Girls work in teams and are supported by mentors to develop a mobile app and to launch a startup. In 2017 over 11,00 girls from more than 100 countries participated in Technovation. Technovation provides a free online curriculum that assumes no prior knowledge, and the technology aspect revolves around using MIT App Inventor, also free. This provides a low threshold for increased inclusion at all socioeconomic levels.

###  Technovation Curriculum

On a team of three, I developed a twelve week, twenty-one unit curriculum for middle school and high school girls participating in the global Technovation Challenge. I developed both the structure and the content of the curriculum. The curriculum is split into four major categories: coding, business principles, marketing, and pitching. I was the principal developer for all seven coding units, all five coding challenges, and some of the marketing units. I was a major contributor and editor for all of the units.

#### Overview

The curriculum is designed for middle school and high school students. Over the seven coding units, it takes students through the basics of programming so they can design a fully functioning mobile app with App Inventor.

####  Student Workbook

In addition to developing all new curriculum, I also developed a student workbook designed to be used with the online curriculum. The workbook is a project management tool for students and their mentors. It highlights key words and activities throughout all of the units and reminds students when to upload to the online platform.

#### Translation
With my team I help guide the efforts to translate the curriculum into eight different languages.

#### Student Video Initative
With my team I created a movement for student alumni of the program to submit youtube videos explaining various hard concepts that they had to learn
