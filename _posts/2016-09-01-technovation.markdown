During my time at Iridescent I worked as a curriculum developer for Technovation. Technovatoin is a global coding and entrepreneruship competition for middle school and high school girls.


###  Technovation Curriculum

On a team of three, I developed at twelve week, twenty-one unit curriculum for middle school and high school girls participating in the global Technovation Challenge. I developed both the structure and the content of the curriculum. The curriculum is split into four major categories: coding, business principles, marketing, and pitching. I was the principal developer for all seven coding units, all five coding challenges, and some of the marketing units. I was a contributor and editor for all of the units.

The curriculum is designed for middle school and high school students. Over the seven coding units, it takes students through the basics of programming so they can design a fully functioning mobile app with App Inventor.

###  Student Workbook

In addition to developing all new curriculum, I also developed a student workbook designed to be used with the online curriculum. The workbook is a project management tool for students and their mentors. It highlights key words and activites throughout all of the units and reminds students when to upload to the online platform.

### Translation
With my team I help guide the efforts to translate the curriculum into eight different languages.

### Student Video Initative
With my team I created a movement for student alumni of the program to submit youtube videos explaining various hard concepts that they had to learn
