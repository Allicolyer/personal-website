With my team I developed the judging materials for Technovation. Girls apps are judged by volunteer, international judges, both virtually and in-person. The judges need to be provided materials that are easy to understand and quick to pick up.

### Juding Rubric

In both 2017 and 2018, I developed the [judging rubric](http://technovationchallenge.org/wp-content/uploads/judging-rubric.pdf) for the competiton. The rubric is aimed to give fair scores to all teams.  It foucses on scoring the teams in five major areas:

* Ideation
* Technical
* Pitch
* Entrepreneurship
* Overall Impression

The judging rubric gives opportunity for judges to award points for excellent work and effort, as well as for their impression of the submission.

### Code Checklist

The [code checklist](http://technovationchallenge.org/curriculum/code-checklist/) was a new aspect I created for the judging process in 2017.

Often times, judges give high scores in the "technical" category for teams that have apps that look nicer to to teams that have better produced demo videos. The goal of the code checklist is to give teams points for "effort" and to level the playing field for teams with less access to technology.

The teams provide explanations for how they used certain components in their code. They can earn up to 10 points for filling in the checklist.

### Judging Training
In 2017, I developed the [judge training](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcFCpaYLqF2zleU3KKg5VY00v3ex1wo-g7) for both virtual and in-person judges.

The judge training aims to take volunteers with zero knowledge of the program to being able to farily judge submissions from girls around the world. The training is broken up into six short vidoes with the following themes:s

1. General Technovation Information
  * Program information and Technovation's mission
2. Parts of a Submission
  * What teams are submitting to be judged
3. Judging Rubric
  * How to interpret the rubric
4. Judging Considerations
  * How to be considerate of teams with different backgrounds
5. Judging Case Study
  * How to leave good comments and feedback on submissions
6. Using the online Judging Platform
  * How to use the website to give scores
